- If YouTube could accurately generates script for videos and I could NOT understand the speaker, then it is my fault of terrible English listening skills; otherwise, it is due to bad oral English of the speaker, usually speakers whose English is as their second language.

- Chances are that some manuals should *be* functioned as a encyclopedia for reference rather than being read thoroughly from start to end.

- PA is interesting, but there are some contents I do not agree: (a) Translating PA0 to English is a trial, but the English is soooooo Chinglish, making it uncomfortable to read; (b) Installing Linux on the physical machine should never be a requirement to complete PA; instead, for novices installing Linux physically is sometimes a great trouble with many issues hard to handle such as power management and display drivers.
